# Starbucks_Offer-Prediction-KNN-ANN-LR-MDC
The objective of this project is to predict purchase offers across four categories: offer received, offer viewed, transaction, and offer completed. To achieve the highest accuracy, four different algorithms(KNN, ANN, Logistic Regression (LR), and Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC))have been implemented.
